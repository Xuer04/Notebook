    > Learning, coding, and creating can often be solitary pursuits. We all need something to motivate and encourage us through the loneliness and lethargy, to start and continue working. 
    >
    > While AI is becoming increasingly proficient in handling functional aspects, dealing with emotional aspects is still a long way off, given their complexity, which even humans struggle to manage. 
    >
    > I always make sure to subtly incorporate air between the body and the clothing. In other words, there is a 'space' in my clothes. It's like the space you find 'between the lines' in a written text. Unfortunately, this aesthetic of space is unique to Japan. It might be an aesthetic we should take pride in. ---- Yohji Yamamoto

???+ quote "Don't Use Homebrew"

    > Apple tries every effort to protect your mac, including strict directory permissions, firewalls and many other privacy policies like asking for folder access permissions when a new app wants to access a folder. **But homebrew makes your mac not as secure as it should be, a huge amount of components on your mac are not well protected.**
    >
    > VSCode is an MIT licensed open source code editor developed by microsoft, right? But actually the stuff you built from source and that you downloaded from the official website are completely two different things, **the official binary releases are licensed under a non-FLOSS (Free and Libre and Open Source Software) license and contains telemetry/tracking**.
    >
    > What’s worse is that the cask repository is enabled by default, newbies who think the apps they installed is FLOSS and trustworthy may actually install an app bundled with telemetry/tracking, and even trojan horse that tries to hack your mac in the way we mentioned in the previous part.

    > *Frome me: As a computer science student, I think the awareness of privacy and security is very important. But homebrew is really convenient and useful for me. It's a trade-off between efficiency and security.*
