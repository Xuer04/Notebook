# Introductions

## About CS106L

- Focus is on code: What makes it good, what powerful and elegant code looks like
- The real deal: No Stanford libraries, only STL
- Understand how and why C++ was made

## C++ History
### Assembly

**Benefits**

- Unbelievably **simple** instructions
- Extremely **fast** (when well-written)
- **Complete control** over your program

**Drawbacks**

- A lot of code to do simple tasks
- Very hard to understand
- Extremely unportable (hard to make work across all systems)

### Invention of C

**C made it easy to write code that was**

- Fast
- Simple
- Cross-platform

**Weakness**

- **No objects or classes**
- Diﬃcult to write **generic code**
- **Tedious** when writing large programs

### Design Philosophy of C++

[Cpp Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)

- **Only add features if they solve an actual problem**
- Express ideas and intent directly in code
- **Compartmentalization(区块化)** is key
- Do not waste time or space
- **Enforce safety at compile time whenever possible**

!!! note "Note"
    C++: Basic Syntax + the STL

    Standard C++: Basic Syntax + std(standard) library

### The STL

- Tons at of EOL general functionality
- Built in classes like maps, sets, vectors
- Accessed through the namespace `std::`
- **Extremely powerful and wel-maintained**
